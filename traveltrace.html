    <div class="col-12 justify-content-center"><h3> TravelTrace allows you to view a trace of a fellow traveler's experience at your location, to help inspire your own trace and create spontaneous memories! </h3></div>
    <div class="col-12 justify-content-center pt-3"><h3> <strong>My Role :</strong> Product Design, User Research, User Interface Design </h3></div>
    <div class="col-12 justify-content-center pt-3"><h3> <strong>Overview :</strong> In an effort to push myself creatively and stay productive during the COVID pandemic, I participated in a 24 hour long hackathon in which I interviewed traveller's, conducted a competitive analysis of similar applications, and created a medium-fidelity prototype of my application.</h3></div>

        <div class="col-12">
        <h2 class="pt-3"><strong>Step 1 : Research. </strong> Understanding the Travel Experience and the User.</h2>
        <h3 class="pt-3">Though many users can be identified, with a time constraint of 24 hours, I decided to focus on one group of users. Young Adults. Travel that is inspired by others and is spontaneous in nature lends itself best to young adults. This is because they are often willing to try new things and become inspired by someone else's shared experience on a mobile app. 
            Families are more likely to go more structured trips as the number of travellers increase. Though it is important to note that this app could target a wider demographic in the future, such as families and older adults. </h3>
        <h3>Thus to better understand the desired travel experience for young adults, I carefully created and sent out neutral questionnaires using typeform to 98 people and conducted structured in person interviews to learn more about their travel experiences.</h3>
        <h3>Here is a visual summary of the results!</h3>
        <img src="./Pie Chart (2).png" />
        
        <hr>
        <h2 class="pt-3"><strong>Step 2 : Synthesis of Data. </strong> Identifying Key Features.</h2>
        <h3 class="pt-3">The results were interesting. I'd like to note that while conducting interviews, many young adults seemed to want more spontaneity in their vacations, they aren't confident enough to go for it!
                    Of the 10 interviewed, 7 credited this due to a fear of not getting their money's due to a lack of planning. 
                </h3>
        <h3>Hence, I summarized the 3 key features my solution would have to encompass.</h3>
        <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <div class="">
                <img src="./Graphic.png" />
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <hr>
        <h2 class="pt-3"><strong>Step 3 : Competitive Analysis. </strong> Identifying strengths and weaknesses of competitors.</h2>
        <h3>With now an idea of our key features, let's take a look at how some competitors achieve those features.</h3>
        <h3 class="pt-3">I identified Google Maps and Instagram as competitors that aren't necessarily focused on travelling but embody some of the desired features of this app well. Instagram is easy and simple to use for posting on the platform and inspiring users. As well as allowing for interactions between users. 
            On the other hand, Google Maps has a intuitive recommendations UI that is based on your location and can be filtered through the use of tags.
        </h3>
        <img class="" src="./compana.png"/>
        <h3>Features from Instagram to consider include the ability to react to posts and the seamless navigation from discover, to profile, and to search.</h3>
        <h3>Features from Google Maps to consider include visual stimuli, ability to filter, and catergories. </h3>
        
        <hr>
        <h2 class="pt-3"><strong>Step 4 : Prototyping. </strong> Prototyping TravelTrace</h2>
        <h3 class="pt-3">Now that it's time to start working on the prototype. I created somes sketches to plan out the user flow and information architecture.</h3>
        <div class="row justify-content-center pt-3">
            <img src="./wireframes.png"/>
        </div>
        <h3>I translated all of my ideas and information from the research, synthesis, analysis, and information flow stage, into a medium-fidelity prototype on Figma. Below is the workspace.
        </h3>
        <div class="row justify-content-center pt-3">
            <img src="./workspace.png"/>
        </div>

        <h2 class="pt-5">The Homepage</h2>
        <div class="row justify-content-center pt-4">
            <img src="./homepage.png"/>
        </div>
        <h3 class="pt-3">As I designed the homepage I focused on the Discovery of “traces” to explore. The discover section is tailored to your current location with easy access to change it. You can also view the tags associated with each trace to prime the user for an understanding of each trace before they ever tap on it.
            The user can scroll further to view more traces in the area in the form of a grid of images. This image focused and simple display reduces the effort to view desired content.
            </h3>
        
        <h2 class="pt-5">Search</h2>
        <div class="row justify-content-center pt-3">
            <img src="./search.png"/>
        </div>
        <h3 class="pt-3">I designed the search section with the main focus of inspiring users to try new travel locations (traces) near them. 
            Hence, I designed a dense but breathable photo grid to maximize the visually appealing content, but inserting some breaks with the ability to see more to make the grid less overwhelming. Furthermore,
             I would implement a filter functionality to customize traces for the user.
        </h3>

        <h2 class="pt-5">Traces</h2>
        <div class="row justify-content-center pt-3">
            <img src="./trace.png"/>
        </div>
        <h3 class="pt-3">Traces can be accessed from anywhere by tapping on any Trace preview. As I designed the trace section I wanted to focus on creating a 
            memory of the travel in a digestible format that outlined each traveler’s day with images of highlights from that day.
             Hence, I created photo grids that summarized each day. Below is a small comment that summarizes the traveler’s day along with what they liked or would do differently. 
        </h3>
        <h3 class="pt-3">I wanted to ensure users could receive all the information needed from the specific item page without 
            the need of a supplementary app like Google Maps. Hence, by expanding a item from the grid, the name of the location, 
            distance away, and a small review are displayed. To foster a sense of community, the number of previous app users 
            who visited is also displayed on the bottom. The next step for this would be to allow for maps integration to 
            navigate to the specified location.

        </h3>

        <h2 class="pt-5">Profiles & Chats</h2>
        <div class="row justify-content-center pt-3">
            <img src="./promes.png"/>
        </div>
        <h3 class="pt-3">I implemented profiles and the ability to communicate to further foster a sense of community and to leverage 
            user’s travel experiences. This allows users to ask further questions about a location or simply make friends. 

        </h3>
        <h3 class="pt-3">The profile screen was kept simple with 2 main functionalities: viewing a collection of traces and messaging.
             To keep flow throughout the app, the grid layout of the user traces is the same as the grid layouts in other parts of the application.

        </h3>

        <h3 class="pt-3">The chats portion is a basic summary of your chats and with the ability to expand each chat.
       </h3>
       <h3 class="pt-3">In the future I may add more functionalities such as followers and likes to each profile,
            but for now keeping a clear distinction between a travel sharing app and a social media platform seems important.
        </h3>
        <hr>
        <h2 class="pt-4">For next time...</h2>
        <h3 class="pt-3">I learned a lot from this specific experience.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="pt-3">It was the first time I really led all aspects of
             design on my own, from research up until prototyping. And it was a challenge. 
             I realized that working on a team in general gives a lot of insight and 
             diversity in thinking. I wish I was able to do some peer design reviews or
              feedback surveys on the product, but due to the time restraint that wasn’t feasible.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="pt-3">I also realized that all aspects of a product are important. 
             Though this specific application was focused on “traces”, a lot of time went 
             into aspects such as discovery, profiles, and chats. Aspects that have the potential further engage your users.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="pt-3">Another lesson I learned was to estimate and allocate my time efficiently. 
            I had underestimated the time I would need to prototype and found myself too focused on 
            each specific component. It is more important to get the product out so that design iterations 
            can be completed and feedback from other designers can be incorporated.
       </h3>
       <h3 class="pt-3">In general, for next time I would: 
        </h3>
        <h3 class="pt-3">1. Be unafraid to take on challenges. 
        </h3>
        <h3 class="pt-3">2. Details are important. Give them thought and effort.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="pt-3 pb-5">3. Allocate my time better and set smaller achievable deadlines.
        </h3>
